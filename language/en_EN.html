                Create your shipping labels automatically using the Lightspeed plug-in. Using this link, you can
                create four types of MyParcel shipments:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Parcel shipments (including ‘Collect from PostNL location’)</li>
                <li>Mailbox parcel</li>
                <li>Unfranked label</li>
            </ul>
            The prices displayed are just examples. Actual rates may vary. For up-to-date prices, please consult the rates in your MyParcel account.

                <p>
                    You can find the MyParcel plug-in in the backoffice of your Lightspeed webshop. Click <span class="nice">Apps</span> in the menu on the left-hand side and then search for <b>MyParcel</b> in the top right-hand corner.
                    When you click the MyParcel Nederland plug-in (recognisable by the small PostNL logo in the upper right corner), you will be directed to the information page for that plug-in. 
                    Click <span class="nice">Install app</span> in the top right-hand corner to create the link. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Before you can proceed to configuration, the MyParcel plug-in needs permission to read and process information. 
                    To grant permission, you need to log in on the screen below with <u>the login details for your Lightspeed environment</u>. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a MyParcel app user, you don’t need to worry about updating the app. The app is updated automatically, which means you’re always using the most recent version.
                </p>
                <h2 id="1_C">1.3 Frequently asked questions about the installation</h2>
                <p>
                <h3>Why does the MyParcel plug-in need to read and process my order?</h3>
                    <i>In order to create an export to MyParcel, the plug-in needs permission to read the information. Once the barcode is pre-registered, we will link it back to the Lightspeed order. Since this involves a change to the order, these permissions are required.</span> </i>

                <p>
                    In order to configure the MyParcel app, go to the home screen in the backoffice of your Lightspeed webshop and click <span class="nice">Apps</span>. 
                    Click <span class="nice">App Store</span> on the left-hand side. Then search for MyParcel in the search bar in the top right-hand corner. 
                    Click the MyParcel app to open the app’s information page and then click <span class="nice">Go to app</span>. 
                    The configuration page will open in a new tab.<br/><br/>

                <p>
                    <b> API-key </b><br />
                    To export shipments to your MyParcel account, you need an API key. You can find it on your MyParcel backoffice by clicking the 
                    <img height="25" alt="" src="media/myparcel_account_icoon.png"> symbol in the top right-hand corner. Then go to <span class="nice">Settings</span> > <span class="nice">Webshops</span> > <span class="nice">General</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b> When to forward to MyParcel?</b><br />
                    Exports can be performed automatically by reading details from orders. 
                    You can export orders depending on both the shipping method (see chapter 2.2) and the shipping status in Lightspeed. 
                    Select <span class="nice">Orders with ‘Not sent’ status</span> if you want to export orders to MyParcel automatically. 
                    They will appear in your MyParcel backoffice automatically within a few minutes. 
                    You do not need to do anything once they appear in the backoffice. 
                    If you would prefer to export orders to MyParcel manually, you can select <span class="nice">Orders with ‘Sent’ status</span>. 
                    You need to set the shipment status to <b>Sent</b> before exporting the order to MyParcel.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    <b> Shipping options </b><br />
                    If you want to offer a specific shipping option as standard for all parcel shipments with destinations in the Netherlands (e.g. insured shipment or signature upon receipt), you can select it here. 
                    Please note that there are additional costs for some shipping options. 
                    You can calculate the shipping costs in your MyParcel backoffice at the top of the page, under <span class="nice">Finance</span> > <span class="nice">Calculate rates</span>.<br/><br/>

                    You can also choose to check that the recipient is aged 18 or over on delivery by switching on the <u> Age Check </u> option.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Delivery options</b><br />
                    You can also let your customers select additional delivery options. Here you can set the delivery options that your customers can select.
                    <strong>NB</strong>: since the delivery options are shipping methods in themselves, enter the <u>total shipping costs</u> here.<br/><br/>

                    If you would prefer not to show a date for the morning and evening delivery options, select the <u>'Do not show delivery date at checkout'</u> option.

                    In order to display the correct delivery options at the checkout, you need to configure shipping methods. 
                    To create a shipping method, click <span class="nice">Settings</span> in the left-hand menu, and then go to <span class="nice">Shop settings</span> and <span class="nice">Shipping methods</span>.
                    You will now see a summary of your shipping methods. To create a new shipping method, click <span class="nice">Add shipping method manually</span>. 
                    To export a parcel shipment, select ‘Standard shipment’ in the next screen and click ‘Continue’. The title that now appears is very important. 
                    The title needs to contain a ‘trigger’ word. The link can identify several words and thereby understand that the following need to be created: </br></br>
                    <span class="nice">PostNL</span>: Parcel</br>
                    <span class="nice">Brievenbus</span>: Mailbox parcel</br>
                    <span class="nice">Ongefrankeerd</span>: Unfranked label</br>
                    <span class="nice">Bol.com</span>: Parcel</br>
                    <span class="nice">Exact</span>: Parcel</br>
                    <span class="nice">Mailbox</span>: Mailbox parcel</br>
                    <span class="nice">Frankering</span>: Unfranked label</br>
                    <span class="nice">Postzegel</span>: Digital stamp</br>
                    <i><u>Please note when using the digital stamp:</u> The postage is determined on the basis of the total weight of the products in the order.
                    If no weights are entered for the products, the shipment will receive postage for 0-20 grams.
                    You can still adjust this per shipment in the back office.</br></br></i>

                    Examples of shipping method titles you can use: <span class='nice'>Verzending via PostNL</span> <span class='nice'>Brievenbuspakje</span> <span class='nice'>Shipment via PostNL</span>. 
                    <br>

                    After entering the title, you can add a description that will be showed under the shipping method at the checkout. 
                    Then click <span class="nice">Add shipping rates</span> to add a shipping rate. Enter a rate and the applicable weights for that rate.
                    <i>MyParcel charges a standard rate for parcels weighing 0-23kg and an XL rate for parcels weighing 23-30kg.</i>
                    Once you have set the rates, click <span class="nice">Save</span>.
                    Select the countries for which the shipping method applies under<strong>Countries</strong> and select how the shipping method will be taxed under ‘Tax rate’. 
                    Once you have finished configuring the settings, click <span class="nice">Save</span> in the top right-hand corner.
                </p>    
                <h2 id="2_C">2.3 Collect from a PostNL location</h2>
                <p>
                    To display <strong> Collect from a PostNL location </strong> at your checkout, the standard PostNL plug-in is required. 
                    First of all, click <span class="nice">Settings</span> in the left-hand menu and then <span class="nice">Shipping methods</span>. 
                    Then click <span class="nice">PostNL settings</span> and switch on integration in the <strong> Login information </strong> section. 
                    <u>The details below do not need to be entered! </u>
                </p>
                    <img alt="" src="media/Lightspeed_PG1.png">
                <p>
                    Scroll down and switch on the <strong> Collect from a PostNL location </strong> option under <span class="nice">Shipping methods</span>. 
                    Scroll down and enter your details under <b>Sender address</b>. 
                    <u> Save these settings before proceeding to the last section in the settings. </u></br></br>
                    
                    Lastly, you need to add a rate for <strong> Collect from a PostNL location </strong> . 
                    If you do not do this, the delivery option will not be visible at the checkout. 
                    Click <span class="nice">Add prices</span> at the bottom of the page to add a rate. 
                    Then select the ‘PostNL - PakjeGemak’ shipping option and <strong> Allow shipping method </strong> to activate the shipping method. 
                    Enter the <strong> shipping costs </strong> and <strong> Countries </strong> and save the page. 
                    Your customers can now select a PostNL location at the checkout!

                 <p>
                    <h3>How do I change the delivery options at my checkout?</h3>
                    <i>In order to turn delivery options on and off or to change the rate, go to the home screen in the backoffice of your Lightspeed webshop and click <span class="nice">Apps</span>.

				<p>
                <h3>When do customers receive a discount for delivery options?</h3>
                    <i>Within Lightspeed, you can offer free shipping for standard shipping methods. 
                        To give you more flexibility, we work with a separate discount for each delivery option. 
                        You can offer your customer free shipping for orders over €50. They still pay for the extra service they want to purchase. 
                        In the example below, evening delivery is activated. 
                        The customer pays €7.30 for this shipping method as standard, but the rate is reduced to €1.25 for orders over €50. </i>
